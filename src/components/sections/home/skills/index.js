              I'm probably not the typical designer positioned behind an
              Illustrator artboard adjusting pixels, but I design. Immersed in
              stylesheets tweaking font sizes and contemplating layouts is where
              you'll find me (~_^). I'm committed to creating fluent user
              experiences while staying fashionable.

              In building JavaScript applications, I'm equipped with just the
              right tools, and can absolutely function independently of them to
              deliver fast, resilient solutions optimized for scale â€”
              performance and scalabilty are priorities on my radar.
